  ISC Forge info
 ----------------

ISC Forge is an automated DHCP validation framework. It uses Scapy and Lettuce
to run various DHCP tests. As of Feb. 2014, it features over 230 DHCPv6 and
90 DHCPv4 conformance tests.

 Dependencies Installation
---------------------------

Forge requires python 2.7.x, Scapy and lettuce. The following steps are
necessary on Debian 7.0. If you use different operating system, your
steps may be slightly different:

(Note: may have to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and place new mirror entry:

   deb http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/debian/ testing main contrib

then run "sudo apt-get update")

The folowing command will install pip (python package installer):

$ sudo apt-get install python-pip

The following command will install lettuce:

$ sudo pip install lettuce

It installs 0.2.19 on Debian 7.0. If you're using any other distro, make sure
that installed lettuce version is at least 0.2.17. You may consider installing
lettuce manually by downloading from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lettuce.

This will install scapy:

$ wget http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/files/scapy-latest.zip
$ unzip scapy-latest.zip

Apply Scappy patches provided in Forge, see below. After that is done,
you may install scapy:

$ cd scapy-2.2.0
$ sudo python setup.py install

As of Feb. 2013, Scapy is quite outdated. When starting it may produce
warnings similar to:

WARNING: No route found for IPv6 destination :: (no default route?)
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/scapy/crypto/cert.py:10:
DeprecationWarning: the sha module is deprecated; use the hashlib module instead
  import os, sys, math, socket, struct, sha, hmac, string, time
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/scapy/crypto/cert.py:11:
DeprecationWarning: The popen2 module is deprecated.  Use the subprocess module.
  import random, popen2, tempfile

Our understanding is that those can be safely ignored for now.

Also you may want to install tcpdump for saving caputers of every test.
This step is optional and tcpdump usage is controlled via init_all.py

$ sudo apt-get install tcpdump

Scapy uses fabric module to control DUT. It is mandatory. Use the latest
version available here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fabric. You can also use
pip to install it:

$ sudo pip install fabric

Scapy uses crypto libraries that may be needed:

$ sudo apt-get install python-crypto
$ sudo pip install ecdsa


 Scapy patches
---------------
Currently the latest Scapy release seems to be 2.2.0. Its main
developer left the project and there is noone to carry on with it, so
the upstream project seems to be in limbo. We need to sort out the
way we'll deal with fixes in Scapy. For now, we keep the patches in
forge/patches/scapy. The scapy code that needs to be patched is in
scapy-2.2.0/scapy/layers.

Please apply each patch using the following (or similar) command:
patch -p0 < name-of-the-patch

For example, if Forge lives in ~/builds/forge, and the Scapy source
is in ~/builds/scapy-2.2.0, then you can patch the Scapy file
"dhcp6.py" with patches 1 and 2 by performing the following:
cd ~/scapy-2.2.0
patch -p 0 <~/builds/forge/patches/scapy/scapy-2.2.0-dhcp6.patch1
patch -p 0 <~/builds/forge/patches/scapy/scapy-2.2.0-dhcp6.patch2

 Configuration
---------------
Configuration management is not well designed yet. The default configuration
is stored in forge/lettuce/features/init_all.py_default. Please copy this file
to features/init_all.py and edit relevant values in this file. The configuration
is not described here in detail example how you should fill it is stored in
forge/lettuce/features/init_all.py_example. Without init_all.py Forge will
not start at all. init_all.py is added to gitignore, so any local changes
you make to this file will be ignored by git.

Also make sure that your ssh server is configured.

Environment example:
To use Forge you will need two PC's. In this configuration author used two virtual
machines using VM VirtualBox. Those machines needs to be connected with internal network
(without any other access to interfaces) in VirtualBox this is called Host-Only network.
You can establish internet connection on other interface if you want. Two different networks
should be used for:
	vboxnet0 - configuration server via ssh
	vboxnet1 - testing.

Author used this configuration:
 ______                                            ______
|      | <----vboxnet0: configuration via ssh---> |      |
| VM 1 |                                          | VM 2 |
|______| <----vboxnet1: testing DHCP        ----> |______|

That's only example, other architectures not tested. If you set up other configuration please
report it on https://github.com/isc-projects/forge to update documentation.

 Usage
-------

IMPORTANT:
	You can dynamically generate user help by running forge/lettuce/help.py. UserHelp.txt
	will contain all informations about using and further developing Forge project.

cd forge/lettuce

The following command should be executed as root because these tests require
opening of privileged ports (DHCP client port):

python run_test.py -6 -t basic

The command above will execute the all existing DHCPv6 tests (as all of them
are tagged "basic"). It is possible to run selected tests only, using appropriate
tags which can be found in the test scenarios.

This is an example of running test:

 Writing new tests
-------------------

Please extend existing *.feature file or create a new one. For example,
see dhcp-val/scripts/lettuce/v6.options.feature. This is sample
content:

# Author: Tomasz Mrugalski

Feature: DHCPv6 options
    This is a simple DHCPv6 options validation. Its purpose is to check if
    requested options are assigned properly.

    Scenario: v6.options.dns-servers
	# Checks that server is able to serve dns-servers option to clients.

	Test Setup:
    Server is configured with 3000::/64 subnet with 3000::1-3000::ff pool.
    Server is configured with dns-servers option with value 2001:db8::1,2001:db8::2.
    Server is started.

	Test Procedure:
	Client requests option 23.
	Client sends SOLICIT message and expect ADVERTISE response.

	Pass Criteria:
	Server MUST respond with advertise message.
	Response MUST include option 23.
	Response option 23 MUST contain addresses 2001:db8::1,2001:db8::2.

	References: v6.options

	Tags: v6 options dns-servers automated

That text is interpreted line by line and each command is
executed. For each of those steps, there is underlying python function
that understands the text. Here is example implementation of the
"Server is configured with X subnet with Y pool." Those functions are
stored in various .py files in features/ dir.

@step('Server is configured with (\S+) subnet with (\S+) pool.')
def prepare_cfg_kea6_subnet(step, subnet, pool):
    if (subnet == "default"):
	subnet = "2001:db8:1::/64"
    if (pool == "default"):
	pool = "2001:db8:1::0 - 2001:db8:1::ffff"
    world.cfg["conf"] = world.cfg["conf"] + \
    "# subnet defintion Kea 6\n" + \
    "config add Dhcp6/subnet6\n" + \
    "config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/subnet \"" + subnet + "\"\n" + \
    "config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/pool [ \"" + pool + "\" ]\n" +\
    "config commit\n"
