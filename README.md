ISC Forge
=========

ISC Forge is an open-source DHCP conformance validation framework. It started as a joint project
done by Internet Systems Consortium, a non-profit company based in Redwood City, California, and
students from Gdansk University of Technology. Currently, Forge is maintained and developed by ISC.

The goal of this project is to develop an automated, open-source DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 validation
framework. The primary focus is on RFC compliance, but other validation aspects are also covered.

In principle, the framework can be extended to cover any RFC compliant DHCP
software, but we're focusing on Kea. In various times, there was some partial
support added also for [ISC DHCP](https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/dhcp) and
[Dibbler](https://klub.com.pl/dhcpv6/). Support for implementations other than
Kea is experimental at best.

The framework is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- Scapy (for packet generation/parsing)
- Pytest (for test management)
- Fabric (for remote server configuration)
